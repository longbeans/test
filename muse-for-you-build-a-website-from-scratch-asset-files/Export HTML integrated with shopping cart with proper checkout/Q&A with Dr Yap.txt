I let Paypal handle the payment part. It is working. The user can enter the quantity and add product to cart. Can checkout. 
The cart will not update the product table (SQL) after checkout. Because if I code to subtract quantity from the table before the actual 
Paypal checkout, the user can cancel Paypal checkout and the quantity will still decrease without actual purchase. 

Shawn: "Can this e-commerce website company do manual data entry? Once the user has paid via Paypal, the company staff data entry member will
	update the product table afterwards?" 

Dr Yap: "Can, yes you can do that."

Focus on the securing part. More important.
